RBM NOTES
=========
My changes have been made to allow me to convert the OpenBSD CVS src repository to Git. The version available at https://github.com/openbsd/src is trunk only. My version has attempted to bring across all history. I'm not much more than a python novice, so purists may think my changes are an ugly hack. They're probably right, oh well.

Credit to https://quorten.github.io/quorten-blog1/blog/2019/02/14/cvs-to-git-process which inspired and guided me to begin this process.
