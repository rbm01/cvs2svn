RBM NOTES
=========
My changes have been made to allow me to convert the OpenBSD CVS src repository to Git. The official OpenBSD Git source repository available at https://github.com/openbsd/src is trunk only. My version includes all the history, with branches and tags. Please note that I don't guarantee that it is 100% complete and accurate.

Also, I'd like to confess that I'm not much more than a python novice, so purists may think my changes to cvs2svn are an ugly hack. They're probably right, oh well.

Credit to https://quorten.github.io/quorten-blog1/blog/2019/02/14/cvs-to-git-process which inspired and guided me to begin this process.
